# ML1 - Predicting the Olympics Medals - Beginner
Predicting Olympics Medals - team level
Credits - Dataquest

# 1. Hypothesis
We are going to predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics

# 2. Finding the relevant data and data cleaning
[teams.csv](https://github.com/Nandikaa-Ganesh/ML1/files/13761909/teams.csv)
This will be the data to be used for the process

# 3. Reshape the data
If the predictors and data to be predicted is not in the proper format or targetted rows, we will have to reshape the data

# 4. Clean the data
Data processing is done to handle with the missing values

# 5. Error metric
Evaluate the performance of our machine learning model. We will be using mean absolute error
Just the actual medals minus the predicted number of medals

# 6. Split the data
Split the data into training and testing data

# 7. Train the model
We are going to use Linear regression Y = a1x1 + a2x2 + B.
We are using two independent variables (number of athletes and number of previous medals) for the determining the dependent variable (number of medals will be won).
